        <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</p>

         <strong>Why We Use Git?</strong>
         <br>
         <p>One of the <strong>Mohibbullah</strong> biggest advantages of Git is its branching capabilities. Unlike centralized version control systems, Git branches are cheap and easy to merge. This facilitates the feature branch workflow popular with many Git users. Feature branches provide an isolated environment for every change to your codebase.</p>
